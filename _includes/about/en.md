# About Me  
Hi, I’m Roger (Keng-Lien) Lin, a Senior Computer Engineering student at UC San Diego with a passion for research, development, and making an impact through technology.  

## Research  
My primary focus is on **multilayer simulation**, where I created **MultiRepast4py**, a Python package that enables multilayer simulations on Repast4py. This tool is designed to make simulations more accessible to researchers, providing valuable insights in areas like combating misinformation and improving public health. I aim to expand my contributions by developing data-driven models and intelligent agents to tackle complex, real-world challenges.  

## Projects  
I’ve worked on a variety of projects through hackathons, academic courses, and professional roles. My projects span areas such as system design, algorithm optimization, and innovative applications. You can explore more about these on the [Projects page](projects).  

## Personal Interests  
Outside of work and academics, I’m an avid reader, writer, and athlete. I enjoy:  
- **Reading & Writing**: I write book reviews, share highlights, and reflect on philosophical ideas.  
- **Sports**: As a former captain of my high school triathlon team, I represented my school in the 2022 National Collegiate Championship. I also play tennis (yes, I was named after Roger Federer!), volleyball, and basketball.  
- **Board Games & Poker**: I love strategy games and enjoy challenging my friends to a game night.  

## Languages  
I’m multilingual and always eager to learn more:  
- **Mandarin**: Native  
- **English**: Fluent  
- **Japanese**: Intermediate (currently learning!)  

Thank you for visiting my page! Feel free to explore my projects, research, and writings.
