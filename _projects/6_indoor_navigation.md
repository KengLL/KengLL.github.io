# Indoor Navigation System with Wi-Fi Signal Integration

## Overview
During HARD Hack 2023, a 24-hour IEEE hackathon, we developed a real-time indoor navigation system utilizing an experimental Wi-Fi signal platform (WiROS). The system combines a Python server for signal processing and JavaScript for visualization, offering a practical solution for indoor navigation and delivery. Our project earned the 1st Place Award for its innovation and functionality.
