# Fall Detection Device: Lightweight and Practical Fall Sensor

## Overview
We developed a fall detection device during HARD Hack 2024, a 24-hour IEEE hackathon. The device uses a G-sensor to detect falls and employs peer-to-peer (P2P) communication to transmit distress signals to nearby devices. This project showcased our innovation in wearable technology, soldering, and embedded systems design, earning us the 1st Place Award.
